# Battery-Notification
This program monitors your computers battery status in the user scope, and send you an email (configureable within the program) and writes to a local log file of your choosing. 

TODO:
- Add email presets (Gmail,Yahoo,etc).
- Allow users to save current email settings to a preset.
- Allow the software to run as a Windows Service, so it can run outside of the user scope.
